  <section>
    <p>A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer are all staying in the same hotel for a conference.</p>

<p>The engineer wakes up in the middle of the night to find the end of his bed is on fire. He grabs the fire extinguisher, points it at the fire and sprays it until the fire is safely extinguished. He goes back to sleep content that he&rsquo;s solved the problem.</p>

<p>The physicist wakes up in the middle of the night to find the end of his bed is on fire. He spots the fire extinguisher, grabs his notepad, then after a few quick calculations puts the fire out with one perfectly timed burst from the extinguisher. He goes back to bed pleased with his elegant solution.</p>

<p>The mathematician wakes up in the middle of the night to find the end of his bed is on fire. He sees the fire, sees the fire extinguisher, and immediately goes back to sleep happy in the knowledge there is a solution.</p>
