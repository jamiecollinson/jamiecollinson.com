  <h1>Google Photos vs Flickr on retina screens</h1>

  <section>
    

<p><em>Update: As of Autumn 2016 this is fixed - way to go Google photos people!</em></p>

<p>Like many I was excited at the launch of the new Google Photos. The user interface is excellent, they offer unlimited storage - albeit with some compression - and I&rsquo;m generally a big fan of Google products and well integrated into the ecosystem.</p>

<p>I was curious to see if I could notice the effects of the &ldquo;high quality&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;free storage&rdquo;) compression option so uploaded a few new pics to test. I was shocked at how poor the image quality appeared. Nothing was sharp. I thought I had messed up and tried a few more photos. All looked terrible, so I switched back to the full size storage (which I&rsquo;d been using before via Google+) and was shocked to see exactly the same poor quality.</p>

<p>Confused I re-downloaded the compressed and full size versions and viewed them locally.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the compression. It&rsquo;s the image rendering on the web gallery - it doesn&rsquo;t adjust for retina class screens (I&rsquo;m using a Pixel). The results are terrible and unless it&rsquo;s fixed I&rsquo;m going to switch back to Flickr. In almost all other respects I prefer Google Photos, this spoils my use-case too much to put up with.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some example screenshots of the same photo uploaded to Google Photos and Flickr (note that you may not be able to see the same issue if you&rsquo;re on a non-retina screen):</p>

<p>If anyone working on Google Photos sees this - please fix! I&rsquo;d love to keep usingGoogle Photos and I can&rsquo;t believe this isn&rsquo;t an issue for lots of other people too.</p>
