  <h1>My year of hustle</h1>

  <section>
    

<p>A year ago I started receiving Amy Hoy&rsquo;s <a href="http://yearofhustle.com/">Year of Hustle</a> emails. She gives an actionable plan for starting your side business over 12 weeks. Breaking down the steps, roadblocks and mindset changes needed to get it done. I&rsquo;m a big admirer of her work, I&rsquo;m sure it helped many people, but I didn&rsquo;t follow her advice. I guess I hadn&rsquo;t hit my <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2014/your-fuck-this-moment-changes-everything">fuck this moment</a>. A lot of her work focuses on mindset, and I wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p>

<p>This year I&rsquo;ve decided things will be different. Since new year I&rsquo;ve been re-reading Year of Hustle, making plans and working on the research she suggests. This post is my first status update, which I&rsquo;ll aim to be making weekly. If you want to follow my progress <a href="http://eepurl.com/cwP9tz">sign up here</a>. These posts will be as transparent as possible. There&rsquo;ll be a separate list for those interested in my products.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>My plan is textbook Amy. I&rsquo;d like to transition into products. I currently have a full time job. While I&rsquo;ve done consulting / freelance I want to escape the time for money thing. I&rsquo;d like to jump straight into products, though may reconsider as I progress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate and could afford a runway of time off. This is attractive, but psychologically I&rsquo;d find it easier to build up some level of success with product sales before going all in. Amy suggests a target of $10k for her year of hustle, so I&rsquo;ve arbitrarily adopted the same target. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of this as my escape velocity. If I know I can hit this for a given amount of effort I&rsquo;ll buy back time from regular work to reinvest in the product side.</p>

<h2 id="near-term-targets">Near term targets</h2>

<p>Amy&rsquo;s plan suggests a total of 96 hours in total. 35 for building the product and the rest for marketing. Sounds about right from my experience.</p>

<p>She doesn&rsquo;t break the 12 weeks down in hours, but that basically means 8 hours per week. Not a lot but daunting when you have a full time job. I don&rsquo;t know how her students with kids have managed! My first goal is to get the basics in place. I&rsquo;m treating this as a kind of week 0. Next I&rsquo;ll be publishing my <a href="/blog/year-of-hustle-12-week-plan">12 week plan</a>, with a detailed description of the tasks for the current week.</p>

<p>So there it is. I know the studies which suggest not sharing public goals, but this felt the most natural way to do things so here we go. I&rsquo;d love to hear any thoughts / suggestions. Email me or comment below.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll shortly be adding an email signup link to the bottom of all my posts, but for now <a href="http://eepurl.com/cwP9tz">here&rsquo;s that signup link again</a>.</p>
