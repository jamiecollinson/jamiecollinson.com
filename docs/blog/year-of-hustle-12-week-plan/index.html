  <h1>12 Week Plan</h1>

  <section>
    

<p><em>This is part of my continuing series on following Amy Hoy&rsquo;s Year of Hustle methodology for creating your first product. You can <a href="http://eepurl.com/cwP9tz">follow along by email</a> or see <a href="/">all my posts on the subject</a>.</em></p>

<p><a href="/blog/my-year-of-hustle">Last time</a> I talked about overall goals. This time I&rsquo;d like to put down a more extensive plan. More detailed for the next few weeks, with less detail as the cone of uncertainty widens. Note for anyone familiar with Amy&rsquo;s methodology I&rsquo;ve cheated and added week 0, and the remaining weeks plans are straight out of Year of Hustle. If you&rsquo;re looking to get a project started I highly recommnend taking a look.</p>

<h1 id="week-0">Week 0</h1>

<p>Use this week to get plans together and begin the process of writing about the journey. Primarily to keep notes along the way, and secondarily because it may be interesting to others following a similar path. Also get into the habit of creating and publishing as often as possible. This is harder than it seems!</p>

<ul>
<li><del>Create email list</del>

<ul>
<li><del>Which provider? How to arrange lists?</del> - <em>Decided on mailchimp due to previous good experiences, and a single list with groups by interest. Hopefully this is simple to change if I regret the decision. Anyone have advice?</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tweak blog format

<ul>
<li>Increase width</li>
<li><del>Update tufte.css</del></li>
<li>Add footer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><del>Add SSL to blog</del> - It&rsquo;s an SEO ranking factor</li>
<li>Add email signup</li>
<li><del>Write 12 week plan</del> -  <em>This post</em></li>
<li>Research on problem to solve. I already have some potentials from previous research. I wanted to say &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; but if you know Amy&rsquo;s work she&rsquo;s very keen on starting with a customer rather than an idea. This is easy to say but incredibly hard to put into practice. I&rsquo;d like to write more on this in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-1">Week 1</h1>

<p>Begin working on product. Create promotional page and break ground on actual work.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coming soon page with description of problem / solution. Includes email signup

<ul>
<li>Where to host?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create first chunk of product</li>
<li>Share coming soon page</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-2">Week 2</h1>

<p>Start promotional work related to product.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a welcome email

<ul>
<li>Configure autoresponder</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create two content pieces

<ul>
<li>Choose topics and create outlines</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Publish one, invite email signups

<ul>
<li>Segment email list (or create second?) for product vs journey interest</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-3">Week 3</h1>

<p>Focus on product, using pre-created promotional material from last week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Publish second piece</li>
<li>Create chunk of product</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-4">Week 4</h1>

<p>Pre-create content marketing&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Create two content pieces</li>
<li>Publish one</li>
<li>Write lesson #1 email delivering a quick win related to the product</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-5">Week 5</h1>

<ul>
<li>Publish second content piece</li>
<li>Create chunk of product</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-6">Week 6</h1>

<ul>
<li>Create chunk of product</li>
<li>Write lesson #2 email related to product work just done</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-7">Week 7</h1>

<ul>
<li>Create two content pieces</li>
<li>Publish one</li>
<li>Write lesson #3 email</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-8">Week 8</h1>

<ul>
<li>Publish second content piece</li>
<li>Create chunk of product</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-9">Week 9</h1>

<ul>
<li>Write lesson #4 email delivering quick win and hints at <em>more</em></li>
<li>Write sales email</li>
<li>Write reminder email</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-10">Week 10</h1>

<ul>
<li>Create chunk of product</li>
<li>Queue launch campaign

<ul>
<li>How? What timings to use?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-11">Week 11</h1>

<ul>
<li>Complete product (!)</li>
<li>Change coming soon page -&gt; sales page</li>
<li>Turn a small chunk of product into a freebie to encourage list signups</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-12">Week 12</h1>

<ul>
<li>Update calls to action / signup forms / email sequence to include incentive

<ul>
<li>Setup in email client</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enable launch email sequence</li>
</ul>

<p>Once done that launch sequence should be automatic and guide all future signups to a (possible) product sale. This is something Amy emphasises, along with building up a marketing funnel along with the product. From professional experience I can assure you that many, many people neglect that side of things. Laid out like this it doesn&rsquo;t look like too much work. But taking a step back it&rsquo;s easy to question how I&rsquo;ll get it all done. I think the key is to make a plan but then focus on getting the work done piece by piece.</p>

<p>Along the way I&rsquo;ll be updating this plan (maybe here, haven&rsquo;t decided yet) and also posting status updates. If you&rsquo;d like to follow along <a href="http://eepurl.com/cwP9tz">sign up here to be notified when I post</a>.</p>
