Can there be anything more satisfying than blogging in emacs, the world's greatest text editor?

** This is a heading

There are many things to like about a heading such as this. For a start it's beautifully presented. Also it is older than I am.

#+BEGIN_SRC js 
  var test = "whatever";
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def my_function(y):
      """This is a python function"""
      return [x for x in y if y % 2 == 0]
#+END_SRC

Now I wonder if I'd like to go to the pub, it has been a tiring afternoon afterall.

And again I'd like to go to the pub, such is the pain of modern life.

** This is a subheading

Headings need subheadings too.
