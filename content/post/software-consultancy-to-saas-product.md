X years ago I joined Cambridge Software. The company had a desktop based CRM system it was selling to a handful of local clients, and was looking to modernise the system and sell it more widely. We were boostrapped by income from consultancy, had some success in that market and expanded[^1]. One thing led to another and before we knew it we were focusing more on bringing in client work than our product. After a few mis-steps - more on that in future posts, but easy to make in the world of consultancy - we're back on track and making real progress.

Now we're truly ready to make the jump to being a product first company. Our ambition is to make 100% of our money from software products, with perhaps a few pieces of consulting work where it makes sense / interests us.

Recently I became the company's managing director, and one of the things I plan to do is increase our openness and share more of our experiences. We're not the only company trying to bootstrap a product, and while we certainly don't know everything we have a few lessons we can share. We'd also love to get outside advice and suggestions, as we've always looked to what others are doing for inspiration and to try to learn.

## Where are we and where have we come from?

[^1]: This is seductively easy to do, but the economics of consultancy mean it can be a trap. You're constantly chasing billable hours to keep everyone busy, and before you know it between sales and billable work you have no time to work on the thing you're trying to bootstrap.
